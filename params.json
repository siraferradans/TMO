{"name":"Tmo","tagline":"Tone Mapping operator in C++","body":"This project implements a Tone Mapping operator published in 2011. Tone Mapping is the problem of compressing the range of a High Dynamic Range image so that it can be displayed in a Low Dynamic Range (regular) screen, without losing or introducing novel details: the final image should produce in the observer a sensation as close as possible to the perception produced by the real world scene. We propose a tone mapping operator with two stages. The first stage is a global method that implements visual adaptation, based on experiments on human perception, in particular we point out the importance of cone saturation. The second stage performs local contrast enhancement, based on a variational model inspired by color vision phenomenology. We evaluate this method with a metric validated by psycho-physical experiments, and in terms of this metric our method compares very well with the state of the art. \r\n","google":"UA-33623835-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
